## Developing for seenrobotics

To develop for seenrobotics, you will eventually need to become familiar with our processes and conventions. This section lists the documents that describe these methodologies. The following list is ordered: you are strongly recommended to go through these documents in the order presented.

1. Our [Code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. This also documents our conflict resolution policy and encourages people to ask questions.
2. Our [Values](docs/VALUES.md), which talks about what we care most about.
3. [Tree hygiene](docs/TREE_HYGIENE.md), which covers how to land a PR, how to do code review, how to handle breaking changes, how to handle regressions, and how to handle post-commit test failures.
4. Our [Style guide](docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md), which includes advice for how to write your code..
