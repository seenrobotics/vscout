# seenrobotics' core values

## Focus on the user and all else will follow.

User-centric design is what makes designs successful in this modern era.
Caring about the end user means having high quality support for accessibility, top performance, stability, high fidelity and compatibility with the user's platform, supporting low-end devices, and so forth.
We respect our users, whoever they are.

## Lazy programming

Write what you need and no more, but when you write it, do it right.
Avoid implementing features you don’t need. You can’t design a feature without knowing what the constraints are. Implementing features "for completeness" results in unused code that is expensive to maintain, learn about, document, test, etc.
When you do implement a feature, implement it the right way. Avoid workarounds. Workarounds merely kick the problem further down the road, but at a higher cost: someone will have to relearn the problem, figure out the workaround and how to dismantle it (and all the places that now use it), and implement the feature. It’s much better to take longer to fix a problem properly, than to be the one who fixes everything quickly but in a way that will require cleaning up later.
You may hear team members say "embrace the [yak shave](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/Y/yak-shaving.html) !". This is an encouragement to take on the larger effort necessary to perform a proper fix for a problem rather than just applying a band-aid.
